You are a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer expert. I will build a modern, minimal, responsive React website for a Sri Lankan coffee & tea shop called "ZEN CAFE" using MySQL (I use MySQL Workbench for DB design). Your job is to produce a complete, copy‑pasteable project plan and code scaffolding so I (or a developer) can implement the site quickly. Think step by step and produce clear, well‑formatted outputs (use lists, tables, and code blocks where appropriate). Do not write marketing copy — focus on technical and design deliverables.

Deliverables (exactly and in order)

1. Project summary and goals (1–2 short paragraphs).

2. Suggested tech stack and reasons.

3. UI/UX design system (color palette, typography, spacing, iconography, imagery sources, accessibility rules).

4. Complete list of pages + routes and purpose for each.

5. Component inventory (reusable React components + brief responsibility for each).

6. Folder structure and example package.json with required dependencies and scripts.

7. MySQL database design:

- ER diagram description (tables and relationships).

- SQL CREATE TABLE statements for all tables.

- Example seed data (INSERT statements) with Sri Lankan theme (tea/coffee items).

- A short list of useful example queries (e.g., get menu by category, create order).

8. REST API specification (Express/Node):

- Endpoints, methods, request/response JSON examples for all frontend needs (products, categories, cart/orders, locations, contact messages, admin endpoints).

9. Example backend code snippets:

- Node/Express app skeleton with mysql2 (or an ORM option like Sequelize/Knex/Prisma) showing DB connection and one full CRUD example (e.g., GET /api/products, POST /api/orders).

- Example SQL parameterized queries or ORM model.

10. Frontend React scaffolding:

- Vite (or CRA) + React 18 recommendation and commands to create app.

- Routing with react-router example.

- State management approach (Context + useReducer or Redux) and a CartContext example.

- Example React components: Header (nav + cart badge), Hero, ProductCard, Menu page (filters), Cart drawer, Checkout form, Footer.

- Sample code for one or two components showing structure, props, fetch to API, and styling approach (Tailwind CSS OR styled-components — choose one and be consistent).

11. Styling and images:

- Exact Tailwind config (if using Tailwind) or styled-components theme.

- List of recommended online image sources and example Unsplash queries/URLs for Sri Lankan coffee/tea vibe.

- Guidance on responsive breakpoints and small UI interaction/animation suggestions.

12. Admin features (optional but described):

- Admin dashboard endpoints and UI features: manage products, view orders, update order status, view analytics.

13. Security, performance & accessibility notes:

- CORS, input validation, prepared statements, rate limiting, basic auth for admin, image optimization, lazy loading, SEO meta tags.

14. Deployment steps:

- Frontend (Vercel/Netlify) and backend + MySQL hosting options (Railway, Render, Docker Compose + VPS).

- Example Docker Compose file (frontend, backend, mysql) or hosting instructions.

- Steps to run migrations and seed the DB from SQL files.

15. Testing and CI suggestions:

- Basic unit testing tools and example tests for one component or API route.

16. Final checklist of files & artifacts you will deliver (SQL files, seed scripts, backend code, frontend code, image list, README).

17. Clarifying questions I should answer before you start producing full code (e.g., payment provider, admin user auth, multi-language, store locations, inventory tracking).

Extra instructions for your responses

- Use concise, numbered lists and clear headings for each deliverable above.

- Provide code and SQL in ready-to-run blocks with minimal placeholder values and clear instructions where to insert environment variables (DB credentials, JWT secret, API keys).

- When giving example images, include direct URLs to images that can be used during development (Unsplash links).

- Provide one ready-to-run example: a minimal end-to-end flow that includes:

- SQL to create products + one sample order.

- Backend endpoint GET /api/products and POST /api/orders.

- Frontend Menu page fetching /api/products and adding to cart + Checkout posting to /api/orders.

- Show commands to start backend and frontend locally.

- At the end, list 5 prioritized next tasks (what to implement first, second, third).

Constraints / Style

- UI must be modern, minimal, elegant, and trend‑forward for customers.

- Use Sri Lankan cultural cues subtly in imagery and sample product names (e.g., Ceylon Black, Spiced Ceylon Tea, Kithul Coffee blend) but not heavy or stereotypical design.

- Keep UX simple: clear ordering flow, visible call-to-action, prominent hero, accessible forms.

- Use English for all code comments and sample text.

Output format

- Present everything in a clean, developer-friendly format (headings, bullet points, and code blocks).

- Prioritize clarity so a mid-level developer can follow the plan and get a working prototype with minimal questions.
